# Parallel Finite Difference Equation Solver for Diffusion Equation

This project implements a parallel finite difference method to solve the 2D diffusion equation using MPI (Message Passing Interface). The diffusion equation is a partial differential equation that describes the diffusion of a quantity over time. It has wide applications in various fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.

## Features

- Solves the 2D diffusion equation using a parallel finite difference method.
- Utilizes MPI for parallelization, allowing the solver to distribute computational tasks across multiple processors.
- Supports domain decomposition for efficient parallelization of the computational domain.
- Includes options for setting initial and boundary conditions.
- Provides functionality to save computed solutions at different time steps for visualization and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MPI (Message Passing Interface) implementation installed on your system. Example implementations include Open MPI, MPICH, and Intel MPI.
- C compiler (e.g., gcc) supporting the MPI library.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MeherchandPN/equation-solver-parallel-finiteDifference-diffusion.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd equation-solver-parallel-finiteDifference-diffusion
    ```

3. Compile the source code using the provided Makefile:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the executable with the desired input parameters:

    ```bash
    mpirun -np <num_processes> ./diffusion_solver <rows> <cols>
    ```

    - `<num_processes>`: Number of MPI processes to be used for parallel computation.
    - `<rows>`: Number of rows in the computational domain.
    - `<cols>`: Number of columns in the computational domain.

2. Optionally, modify the source code (`diffusion_solver.c`) to customize initial and boundary conditions, time steps, and other parameters as needed.

3. Visualize the computed solutions using visualization tools compatible with the output file format (e.g., Python's Matplotlib library).
